# MyShifts-Frontend
The frontend of the web app where user is able to take shifts available at the workplace, and is also able to request one's shifts to be covered.
- logged in user can see their own shifts, and also shifts available for taking for each date.
- user can request their own shift to be covered, and take any shifts available.
- Once a user confirms giving out shifts/taking shifts, both the user and the employee who requested shifts to be covered will get email notifications with details of the transactions.

Future feature:
- we would like to build an admin page for the supervisor, who will be able to assign shifts to employees. 
- supervisor will get notifed of any changes in ownership of shifts.
- supervisor will be able to adjust and changes in shifts allocations if required.

Technolgies used:
- Javascipt, HTML/CSS
- JQuery (Calendar only)
- axios (API calls)
